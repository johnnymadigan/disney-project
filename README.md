# **About**
My first *Python* project at the *Queensland University of Technology*. Using *Turtle Graphics*, the task requires us to design and easily reproduce complex visuals as tiles in a grid. Given a randomly generated pattern via nested lists, the program needs to read these instructions and populate the grid with these tiles accordingly. Tiles vary in size, design, with some broken.

# **Run**
- Launch your OS' terminal
- Navigate (`cd`) to the project directory
- Run with 'python2 main.py'

# **Call Graph**

# **Dependencies**
Relies on *Turtle Graphics* and therefore *tkinter*. If your *Python* Interpreter version supports *Tk* then you can use it to run the program. Versions 2.7 and 3.8 have been proven to work.
